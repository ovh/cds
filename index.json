	"content": "Consumer Two type of consumer:\n first level: GitLab, GitHub, CorporateSSO, LDAP, Local. n level: Builtin.  A builtin consumer can be created by a user. Every builtin consumer should have a parent consumer that can also be another builtin consumer. Using a child consumer you can give permission for all or a part of what its parent can access.\nGroups A consumer includes a list of groups. Wildcard for a first level. Wildcard or a list of group for a builtin consumer. A user can add only group if is member of it. (A cds admin can add any group inside a builtin consumer). A child consumer can only have groups that are in its parents.\nScopes Scope are setup on api routes, this mecaniscm allows to let a consumer access only a part of CDS handlers. A consumer includes a list of Scopes, first level consumer contains all scopes by default (wildcard). Second level consumer should at least include one scope. Each scope added in a builtin consumer should be in its parent.\nHatchery: service, hatchery, run execution, worker model\nHook: service, hooks, project, run\nOther: service\nScopes list:\n User: access to handlers for user profile and contact management. AccessToken: access to handlers for user authentication management, create new consumers, revoke sessions\u0026hellip; Action: access to handlers for action management. Admin: access to admin handlers. Group: access to handlers for group management. Template: access to handlers for workflow template management. Project: access to handlers for project management. Run: access to handlers for workflow run management. RunExecution. Hooks. Worker. WorkerModel: access to handlers for worker model management. Hatchery. Service.  Builtin consumer regen This allow you to get a new consumer signin token for a builtin consumer. Only consumers that are not disabled can be regen. If there are invalidated groups in the consumer, they will be removed. When a consumer is regenerated, its issued date will be updated so all old signin token will be invalidated.\nChanging user\u0026rsquo;s group If a user is removed from a group, the group should be invalidated in all the consumers that contains it. If it was the last group of the consumer we also want to disable the consumer. If user is re-added in a given group we restore consumers where this group was invalidated. Also if the consumer was disabled we re-enable it.\nDeleting a group Is a group was removed we removes all references to this group from all consumers. If it was the last group for a consumer the consumer will be disabled.\nChanging user ring A CDS admin can create builtin consumers that includes all groups including the shared.infra group. A CDS maintainer or a simple user can only includes some of its groups. When a user is downgraded from admin to another ring, we invalidates all the groups in its consumers where he is not part of. If all the groups are invalid the consumer will be disabled. When a user ring is set to admin, we check if there are consumers that contains invalid group that can be restored and re-enable consumers if needed.\n"

	"content": "To build CDS, the development team took their inspiration from the Continuous Delivery principles:\n The process for releasing/deploying software MUST be repeatable and reliable. Automate everything! If somethings difficult or painful, do it more often Keep everything in source control Dev Done means “released” Build quality in! Everybody has responsibility for the release process Improve continuously Build binaries only once Use precisely the same mechanism to deploy to every environment Smoke test your deployment If anything fails, stop the line  ref. http://devopsnet.com/2011/08/04/continuous-delivery/\nThe team triggered the project after several dissatisfying attempts to integrate and use other open-source and commercial build tools at large scale. Even if most of the tested tools did not contradict the principles above, they were failing at the \u0026ldquo;real world\u0026rdquo; test. In fact, their limitations were quickly visible at scale. As the number of managed projects grew, these tools were showing signs of weakness of became hard or expensive to manage and maintain. Basic software updates of the tools themselves needed preparation and downtime. Basic configuration changes needed to be centralized on a single team thus creating an organizational bottleneck. etc.\nThis is why, at the start of the project, the team knew exactly the requirements that would make CDS a suitable tool for their daily operation. These requirements later became the CDS Building Design Principles listed below.\n1 - Self-Service In massively distributed architectures, development teams work independently to improve and deploy applications and services.\nGrowth in the number of teams and projects create some interesting dynamics where a handful of projects are launched every week. Some of them die at the proof-of concept stage while some others do survive and bring value. Of course, such a turnover rate comes with an ever-growing wishlist of build, test and deployment environments.\nCentralizing the creation and the configuration of these deployments on a single team is considered harmful. At best, it would create an organizational bottleneck where the Continuous Delivery is overwhelmed with requests and delays their execution. At worst, this multi-layered/multi-team process would look too heavy from the outside and push the developers to censor themselves putting a soft break to the innovation dynamics.\nCDS is built around a strong culture of self-service: Whenever it is possible, the control is delegated to the development teams and to the ops teams. Creation, configuration and deletion of CDS projects is completely decentralized. Moreover, project creators can re-delegate parts of their permissions to their teams through powerful built-in group ACLs.\nUsers are also free to add their own workers to the system if the workers provided by the Continuous Delivery team do not suit their needs. This covers the specific cases where specific hardware or software is required to build or test a software. To do so, users just need to start the CDS worker binary from their own machines and give it the IP address and the credentials of the CDS API. A worker CDS is a simple binary, you do not need libraries or particular JVMs on your machine to run it. CDS workers are compatible with Linux, macOS, FreeBSD as well as Windows, in architectures 386, amd64, arm or arm64.\nTo implement this strong self-service culture the team files an issue everytime a user needs the help of a CDS administrator to achieve a simple day-to-day task.\n2 - Horizontal Scalability CDS is built to scale. And this capability is challenged everyday in a large-scale production environment. This ability to scale has been made possible thanks to a simple design principle: statelessness\nCDS\u0026rsquo;s API servers are completely stateless. They do not store anything on the fileSystem. With this \u0026ldquo;share-nothing\u0026rdquo; architecture, servers can be deployed as much times as required to support the load. Instances can be spawned and decommissioned dynamically to handle usage surges when required while keeping the cost at its lowest when the platform is underused. All you need to provide is a scalable and highly available database.\n3 - High Availability When working with a continuous delivery tool on a daily basis using an actively maintained tool like CDS, updates are frequent. For example, it is frequent that OVH\u0026rsquo;s main CDS instance gets updated and redeployed several times a day.\nThis fast delivery and reactivity couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been possible without CDS\u0026rsquo;s High Availability architecture. The statelessnes property, described above, is again the property that allows to update API servers independently without interrupting any of the running jobs.\n« The loss of a CDS API server is a non-event ».\n4 - Pipeline Reutilisability CDS\u0026rsquo;s built-in don\u0026rsquo;t-repeat-yourself features help you minimize your effort when you need to build, test and deploy hundreds (thousands?) of projects with a similar workflow. This is especially useful when you are managing a micro-services-based infrastructure where containers are usually built and deployed the same way.\nA system of templating allows to customize the build runs depending on the apps to be built and on the deployment environments.\nThis feature is essential as it allows to quickly deploy new applications, provided that a similar one already exists in CDS.\n5 - REST API CDS can be fully operated through its REST API. The API is used by the CDS\u0026rsquo;s UI but also by the workers. All components speak the same language: REST.\nBoth the UI and the CLI use exclusively the REST API to operate. Therefore, if you can do it through the UI or the CLI, then you can do it through the REST API.\n« Everything must be scriptable, automatable ».\n6 - Customizable CDS is shipped with a lot of built-in steps and hatcheries that should most users' needs. But, power users will want to customize it to suit their own needs. This is why CDS has been designed to accept plug-ins for steps actions and the REST API-based hatchery operations allow and easy addition of customized hatcheries.\n"

A new workspace is assigned for each new run of a job.\nA standard build job looks like this:\nYou can use « built-in » actions, such as checkoutApplication, script, jUnit, artifact upload/download.\n The checkoutApplication action clones your Git repository The Script action executes your build command as “make build” The artifactUpload action uploads previously-built binaries The jUnit action parses a given Junit-formatted XML file to extract its test results  Notice: you cannot share a workspace between jobs or between two runs of the same job. Actions Artifact Upload and Artifact Download can be used to transfert artifacts between jobs.\nA Job is executed by a worker. CDS will select a worker for the job dependending on the Requirements the job\u0026rsquo;s requirements.\nSteps The steps of a job is the list of the different operations performed by the CDS worker. Each step is based on an Action pre-defined by CDS. The list of all actions is defined on *\u0026lt;your cds url ui\u0026gt;/#/action*. When a step fails, its parent job is stopped and marked as failed.\nYou can define a Step as final. It mean that even if the job fails before reaching it, the step will be executed anyway. The final steps are executed after all other steps.\nYou can find below an example of steps creation in CDS. You have 2 configuration flags:\n Optional: The failure of the step does not cause the failure of the whole job. Always executed: with this flag checked, this step will be executed even if previous steps fail. This can be helpful, for example, if you run tests in a step and you would like to upload the tests report even if the tests fail.  "

This service is dedicated to receive and store CDS’s job logs.\nWe created this service to be able to move out job\u0026rsquo;s logs from CDS database to an object storage provider (more information about this list of providers here).\nIn this release, logs are stored both in CDN storage units and CDS database to facilitate migration. Old log data and database table will be removed in a future release.\nPrepare CDN service configuration  Init CDN configuration using engine binary.  $ engine config new cdn \u0026gt; cdn.toml Depending your needs you can change the default configuration to use a different storage unit (see: cdn.storageUnits.storages), the default configuration is using a local unit with encryption.\n Generate a auth consumer for your new CDN service.  $ cdsctl consumer new me \\ --scopes=Service,Worker,RunExecution \\ --name=\u0026#34;cdn\u0026#34; \\ --description=\u0026#34;Consumer for cdn service\u0026#34; \\ --groups=\u0026#34;shared.infra\u0026#34; \\ --no-interactive Builtin consumer successfully created, use the following token to sign in: xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.4Bd9XJMIWrfe8Lwb-Au68TKUqflPorY2Fmcuw5vIoUs5gQyCLuxxxxxxxxxxxxxx $ engine config edit --output cdn.toml cdn.toml cdn.api.token=xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.4Bd9XJMIWrfe8Lwb-Au68TKUqflPorY2Fmcuw5vIoUs5gQyCLuxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Generate a auth consumer for CDS unit for CDN  $ cdsctl consumer new me \\ --scopes=Project,Run \\ --name=\u0026#34;cdn-storage-cds\u0026#34; \\ --description=\u0026#34;Consumer for cds storage unit\u0026#34; \\ --groups=\u0026#34;shared.infra\u0026#34; \\ --no-interactive Builtin consumer successfully created, use the following token to sign in: xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.4Bd9XJMIWrfe8Lwb-Au68TKUqflPorY2Fmcuw5vIoUs5gQyCLuxxxxxxxxxxxxxx $ engine config edit --output cdn.toml cdn.toml cdn.storageUnits.storages.cds.token=xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.4Bd9XJMIWrfe8Lwb-Au68TKUqflPorY2Fmcuw5vIoUs5gQyCLuxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The CDS unit will be useful to migrate logs from CDS database to CDN.\nInit CDN database CDN service will require a Postgres database, you can use the same database for CDS API and CDN with different schema or use two distinct databases. To init the database please follow the database management guide here.\nStart CDN service By default CDN log processing and migration is active for all projects and you\u0026rsquo;ll have to start the migration process manually.\nMigration will be executed in two steps, the first one will populate the CDN database from known log items. Then log content will be accessible through the temporary CDS unit and CDN will start to sync your storage unit with CDS unit.\nIf your CDS instance handles a lot of workflows, the migration may take a long time, thanks to the feature flip, you will be able to manually define the list of CDS projects that should use CDN to gradually migrate your projects to CDN.\n (Optional) Set feature flipping for CDN logs to migrate only some projects.  cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; feature.yaml name: cdn-job-logs rule: return project_key == \u0026#34;PROJECT1\u0026#34; or project_key == \u0026#34;PROJECT2\u0026#34; EOF cdsctl admin feature import feature.yaml  Start CDN service and migration.  At this step, you will be able to start the CDN service. It will start processing logs for activated projects.\nStart migration using the command line:\n$ cdsctl admin cdn migrate This will only migrate activated projects. If you are using feature flipping to gradually migrate your projects, you will need to rerun this command each time you change this list of projects.\nYou can follow the migration from CDN logs or with the CDS command line:\n$ cdsctl admin cdn status Other changes  The CDS migrate service is now able to manage SQL migrations on both API and CDN databases. Its configuration file format changed to add CDN database config. Please use the following command to generate a config example and update your existing one to this new format.  $ engine config new migrate  Workflow Run will now contains a snapshot of required secrets when starting. This allows changing a secret on CDS entities without breaking existing runs. A migration script will generate this snapshot for recent Workflow Runs (\u0026lt; 3 Months), others will be set to read only mode. CDS UI service will now proxy both API and CDN calls, please add the following lines in your existing config.  # CDN µService URL cdnURL = \u0026#34;http://localhost:8089\u0026#34; # change this URL if needed to match CDN address "

CDS µServices A CDS µService is a process that can be launch by the engine binary.\n api: this is the main µService.  Each api must shared the same PostgreSQL and redis databases. All other CDS µServices have to communicate with api. The database user does not need to have the admin rights to create / alter tables.   cdn: the cdn service is dedicated to receive and store CDS\u0026rsquo;s logs and artifacts.  Each cdn must shared the same PostgreSQL and redis databases. The database user does not need to have the admin rights to create / alter tables.   ui: the ui service serves the CDS UI static files.  It\u0026rsquo;s the only service that can be accessed by end users. http path: /cdsapi - proxypass to reach CDS API. http path: /cdshooks - proxypass that can be used by some external integrations or webhooks.   hooks: this service manages Hooks.  You can multi-instanciate this service, it uses a redis to synchronize all tasks over all instances. Users and some integrations need to send HTTP requests to this service, you can use the proxypass /cdshooks on the CDS UI to reach this service.   vcs: The aim of this µService is to communicate with Repository Manager as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket\u0026hellip;  You can multi-instanciate this service, a redis is used to synchronize tasks over all instances.   repositories: this µService is used to enable the as-code feature.  Users can store CDS Files on their repositories. This service clones user repositories on local filesystem. You can\u0026rsquo;t multi-instanciate this service for now.   elasticsearch: user timeline and vulnerabilities computed are stored on a elasticsearch through this µService.  It\u0026rsquo;s optional unless you want theses features activated on your CDS.   hatchery:local: the local hatchery spawns CDS Workers locally.  All workers shares the same filesystem. Not recommanded for production with shared.infra group   hatchery:swarm: the swarm hatchery spawn CDS Workers with docker.  A single process of hatchery:swarm can managed many docker daemons. You can use Service Requirement with this hatchery. This hatchery uses the worker model docker.   hatchery:openstack: the openstack hatchery creates Virtual Machine with a CDS Worker inside.  This hatchery uses the worker model openstack.   hatchery:kubernetes: the kubernetes hatchery creates a CDS Worker inside a Pod.  You can use Service Requirement with this hatchery. This hatchery uses the worker model docker.   hatchery:marathon: the marathon hatchery run CDS Worker as a marathon application.  This hatchery uses the worker model docker.   hatchery:vsphere: the vSphere hatchery creates Virtual Machine with a CDS Worker inside.  This hatchery uses the worker model vsphere.   migrate: this µService is used to run database migrations to upgrade your CDS Installation.  The configuration needs a postgreSQL user with rights to create / alter tables on postgreSQL.    Single Process With a single CDS Engine process, you can run all µServices. This is very convenient for testing CDS locally but it\u0026rsquo;s not recommanded for a production installation.\nMulti-Processes The binary engine can be used to launch in different processes each µService. This is recommanded for a production installation.\nEach µService can be multi-instanciated, example:\n 6x $engine start api, each api shared the same PostgreSQL and redis. 6x $engine start cdn, each cdn shared the same PostgreSQL and redis. 3x $engine start ui. 3x $engine start hooks, each hooks shared the same redis. 3x $engine start vcs, each hooks shared the same redis. 3x $engine start elasticsearch. 1x $engine start repositories.  RAM resources needed Example of an installation for a production with 18.000 jobs launched per day:\n 6x $engine start api  RAM: 3Go per instance Redis: 128Mo   6x $engine start cdn  RAM: 3Go per instance Redis: 4Go   3x $engine start ui  RAM: 128Mo per instance   3x $engine start hooks  RAM: 256Mo per instance Redis: 256Mo   3x $engine start vcs  RAM: 256Mo per instance Redis: 256Mo   3x $engine start elasticsearch  RAM: 256Mo per instance   1x $engine start repositories  RAM: 256Mo per instance   1x $engine start migrate  RAM: 128Mo per instance   hatcheries: 256Mo per instance  "

Each Variable must have a type and a value. You will be able to play with those variables using {{.cds.app.my-variable}} and CDS_APP_MY_VARIABLE. The recognized types are string, password, text, boolean or number. By default the type is string.\nTo be able to write secret in the CDS yaml files, you have to encrypt data within your CDS project.\n$ cdsctl encrypt MYPROJECT my-data my-super-secret-value my-data: 01234567890987654321 The command returns the value: 01234567890987654321. You can use this value in a configuration file.\nKeys Keys managed in CDS in are from two types: SSH and PGP. Let\u0026rsquo;s import an application with a SSH Key. Those key could be important to manage your Git repositories.\n➜ ~ cat app.yml name: myapp keys: app-mysshkey: type: ssh ➜ ~ cdsctl application import MYPROJ app.yml Application myapp successfully created SSH key app-mysshkey created on application myapp CDS has just created a new SSH keypair on its own. To be able to keep this keypair for the future, you can gather an identifier by running an export.\n➜ ~ cdsctl application export FSAMIN myapp version: v1.0 name: myapp keys: app-mysshkey: type: ssh value: 19a2ca3271854c3183aabb4af9df05e1 Note that each time you want to import the application and keep the keypair as it, you must provide the exported value.\nIf you want to keep your application in your git repository and let CDS configure and reconfigure the application automatically, we suggest to use the regen option. With this option CDS will generate the SSH keypair if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, and won\u0026rsquo;t touch it on each import.\nname: myapp keys: app-mysshkey: type: ssh regen: false VCS To be able to link an application to a VCS, you must have at least one repository manager properly configured on your CDS instance. Each application in CDS can be linked to one repository on a repository manager.\nDefining your VCS setup on an application will allow to benefit for the deep integration of CDS and the Repository Manager (such as GitHub). So you would be able to setup webhooks, browse through commits and publish your releases easily.\n   Setting Definition     vcs_server Set the name of the repository manager on which on repository is hosted   repo The fullname of the repositiry i.e myorg/myrepo   vcs_connection_type Define the way you would like to checkout the code. Allowed values are ssh or https   vcs_ssh_key If you set vcs_connection_type = ssh, choose the ssh key you want to use to git clone   vcs_user If you set vcs_connection_type = http, set the HTTP Username   vcs_password If you set vcs_connection_type = http, set the HTTP Password   vcs_pgp_key If you want to commit and sign, you can choose here a PGP Key    Please note that you can use key at project or application level. Default vcs_connection_type is https. If your repository is public, you can omit vcs_connection_type, vcs_user and vcs_password.\nExample version: v1.0 name: myapp repo: myorg/myapp vcs_server: github vcs_connection_type: ssh vcs_ssh_key: proj-ssh-key vcs_pgp_key: proj-pgp-key Now with this setup you will be able to use the actions CheckoutApplication and Release in your pipelines.\nDeployment In this section, you can define the setup to deploy your application on a platform. To be able to setup it, you must have at least one integration supporting deployment properly configured on your CDS instance.\nThe deployments section is the list of the settings you can use to deploy to several platforms. For instance, if you want to be able to be deploy the same application, from the same helm chart with subtle changes in variables, depending on the cluster, you can set the following configuration.\nversion: v1.0 name: myapp deployments: my-kubernetes-cluster-A: namespace: my-namespace-A helm_chart: value: deploy/helm/ helm_values: type: deploy/helm/values-cluster-A.yaml helm_version: type: 2.12.2 my-kubernetes-cluster-B: namespace: my-namespace-B helm_chart: value: deploy/helm/ helm_values: type: deploy/helm/values-cluster-B.yaml helm_version: type: 2.12.2 The list of the availabe deployment platform is available from the Web UI on the project / integration section, or with the command cdsctl project integration list\n➜ ~ cdsctl project integration list MYPROJ +-----------------------------+ | NAME | +-----------------------------+ | my-kubernetes-cluster-A | | my-kubernetes-cluster-B | +-----------------------------+ The settings depend on the integration. Please refer to the integration documentation.\nNow you are ready to use the DeployApplication action in your pipelines.\n"

This is a standard Continuous Integration \u0026amp; Continuous Delivery Workflow.\nSo, we have to trigger this workflow on each commit, on every git branches. This will be useful to compile code from all developers and deploy master branch if the build is Ok.\nThe application is linked to a GitHub Git Repository, we have two choices to trigger automatically the workflow:\n add a Git Repository Webhook or add a Git Repository Poller.  The difference between both is simple: a Git Repository Webhook does not work if your CDS Instance is not reachable from GitHub. So, we have to add a Git Repository Poller\n Select the pipeline root, then click on \u0026lsquo;Add a hook\u0026rsquo; Choose a Git Repository Poller The poller is added and linked to your first pipeline   view screenshots...   Select the pipeline root, then click on \u0026lsquo;Add a hook\u0026rsquo; Choose a Git Repository Poller The poller is added and linked to your first pipeline   8 - Run your workflow It\u0026rsquo;s time to launch your Workflow, click on the green button \u0026lsquo;Run workflow\u0026rsquo;.\n On the popup, you can choose the git branch, then click on green button \u0026lsquo;OK\u0026rsquo; The first pipeline is building (you can double-click on it, it\u0026rsquo;s a shortcut), you can see logs.

These backends are call units and there are two types of units in CDN:\n  Buffer unit: To store logs and artifacts of incoming jobs, these units are designed to be fast for read / write operations, but with limited capacity.\n  Storage Unit: to store complete job\u0026rsquo;s logs and artifacts.\n  When logs or file are received by CDN from a cds worker, it will first store these items in its buffer. Then, when the item is fully received, it will be moved to one of the configured storage units. If the CDN service is configured with multiple storage units, each unit periodically checks for missing items and synchronizes these items from other units.\nCDS UI and CLI communicate with CDN to get entire logs, or stream them.\nSupported units  Buffer (type: log): Redis.

	"content": "Example with a creation of a vSphere hatchery   First of all you need to create a new package like the other into the hatchery package. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this package vSphere for our example.\n  You have to implement the Service interface (see here) in order to configure launch this new hatchery mode via CDS engine CLI.\n  Your have to create a Configuration structure composed of the hatchery.CommonConfiguration and the variables you need to access to vSphere API. You finally have to update the engine main.go file to manage this new service and add and manage the configuration structure as part of the global configuration.\n  You need to implement the hatchery interface (see here)\n  The Init function is useful to create the struct and to set all of these parameters, for our example it\u0026rsquo;s in this function that we\u0026rsquo;re going to create all our vSphere informations fetched from the vSphere API. (cf init.go). In this case we create a new vSphere client to request vSphere API, a new finder to fetch all informations about our vSphere host. In fact, all informations that we need to spawn and kill the vms with our workers inside on the vSphere infrastructure. This function is also used to create and register the hatchery on the API via the function in the sdk called hatchery.Register. This register will give you the id of your hatchery.\n  The ID function returns the id of the current hatchery that comes from the hatchery client registered with the sdk previously in the Init function.\n  The ModelType function returns the type of the hatchery, in this case it\u0026rsquo;s vSphere type. We can create a constant VSphere inside our sdk package.\n  Hatchery function returns the hatchery struct initialised previously in the Init function.\n  Client function returns the sdk client initialised previously in the Init function too.\n  NeedRegistration is used to know if your worker model need registration. For example if a user update a worker model you have to rebuild the virtual machine model linked to this worker model. And this function returns true if the worker model was updated after the virtual machine model was created on vSphere. In order to know that for vSphere we have add some metadata on each vms in order to add more custom data as the last creation of this vm for example.\n  WorkersStartedByModel returns all workers which are running with a worker model. In our vSphere example, in order to know that we register a string metadata called model which tell us the name of our worker model.\n  WorkersStarted returns all workers include those which are running to build a vm model or to register a worker model. For example in the vSphere case, in order to count them we all prefix our worker spawned with worker-.\n  CanSpawn is where the magic happens, it\u0026rsquo;s in this function that you spawn your vms with the right configuration. In fact with vSphere we check if there is a vm model already created for the worker model passed in parameter. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t we create a vm model with the user data store in worker model infos. Then we spawn a vm with right environment variables created from informations passed in parameters (workerModel, registerOnly, \u0026hellip;) and with a script inside the vm that download the worker binary, execute it and shutdown when all is done. In this function we also check if the worker should be launch to register or to execute steps. When we launch a worker for register it means that the worker is launched and then send all there binary capabilities to the API for this worker model but don\u0026rsquo;t execute any jobs.\n  In our vSphere implementation we also launch multiple goroutine to clean and kill workers which seem down or in error. It\u0026rsquo;s a ticker that check all vms state in a periodic way.\n  Test If you want to test that you just have to launch it like that:\n$ engine start hatchery:vsphere --config config.toml "

This pipeline has four stages:\n The Build Minimal stage is launched for all Git branches. The main goal of this stage is to compile the Linux version of CDS binaries. The Build other os/arch stage is only launched on the master branch. This stage compiles all binaries supported by the os/arch: linux, openbsd, freebsd, darwin, windows – 386, amd64 and arm. The Package stage is launched for all Git branches. This stage prepares the docker image and Debian package. Finally, the Publish stage is launched, whatever the Git branch.  Most tasks are executed in parallel, whenever possible. This results in very fast feedback, so we will quickly know if the compilation is OK or not.\nStages Usually in CDS a build pipeline is structured of the following stages:\n Compile stage: Build the binaries Analysis \u0026amp; Unit Tests stage: Run all unit tests and analyse code quality Packaging stage: Build the final package, Virtual Machine Image or Docker Image.  A Stage is a set of jobs that will be run in parallel. Stages are executed sequentially, if the previous stage is successful.\nYou can define trigger conditions on a stage, to enable/disable it under given conditions. For instance, you may want to run the Compile Stage and Analysis \u0026amp; Unit Tests stage on all branches but dedicate the Packaging Stage run on master and develop branches only.\n"

Click on create to create the workflow.   6 - Add a Hook on your workflow In this example, we create a Workflow to build, tag and release an application.\nSo, we have to trigger this workflow on each commit, on every git branches - and on each tag created. This will be useful to compile code from all developer and sometimes create a tag from master branch if the build is Success.\nThe application is linked to a GitHub Git Repository, we have two choices to trigger automatically the workflow:\n add a Git Repository Webhook or add a Git Repository Poller.  The difference between both is simple: a Git Repository Webhook does not work if your CDS Instance is not reachable from GitHub. So, we have to add a Git Repository Poller\n Select the pipeline root, then click on \u0026lsquo;Add a hook\u0026rsquo; Choose a Git Repository Poller The poller is added and linked to your first pipeline   view screenshots...     7 - Create a tag  Select the pipeline \u0026lsquo;build-pipeline\u0026rsquo;, then click on the sidebar \u0026lsquo;Add a pipeline\u0026rsquo; Create a new pipeline named \u0026lsquo;create-tag\u0026rsquo;, then select the application \u0026lsquo;my-java-app\u0026rsquo; We don\u0026rsquo;t need an environment, neither platform for create a tag, Click on \u0026lsquo;Finish\u0026rsquo; Edit the pipeline \u0026lsquo;create-tag\u0026rsquo; Click on Edit as Code button, then paste that code:  version: v1.0 name: create-tag parameters: tagLevel: type: list default: major;minor;patch description: major, minor or patch jobs: - job: CreateTag steps: - checkout: \u0026#39;{{.cds.workspace}}\u0026#39; - gitTag: path: \u0026#39;{{.cds.workspace}}\u0026#39; tagLevel: \u0026#39;{{.cds.pip.tagLevel}}\u0026#39; tagMessage: Release from CDS run {{.cds.version}}   view screenshots...

We don\u0026rsquo;t want to launch it on each commit - we want to decide when to launch it.\n Click on the pipeline \u0026lsquo;create-tag\u0026rsquo; Add two Run Conditions:  cds.manual = true git.branch = master   Launch the workflow, select the tag level, then click on Run   view screenshots...   Edit Run Conditions. Launch the workflow. The workflow is stopped, because you set cds.manual to true in your run conditions. Select the pipeline, then click on the \u0026lsquo;play\u0026rsquo; button. You can choose the tag level. Tag is created, cf. step logs.

	"description": "",
	"content": "In CDS if you want to launch a pipeline in your workflow only in specific cases you can add conditions. For example, if you want to run a pipeline automatically only if the value of git.branch is master.\nTo edit your pipeline condition on the user interface, you have to select a node under edition mode of your workflow and click on Edit run conditions like this:\nThere are 2 types of conditions:\nBasic run conditions With this type of conditions you can add multiple comparisons with a basic operators (=, !=, match for a regular expression, \u0026gt;=, \u0026gt;, \u0026lt;=, \u0026lt;). The variables syntax here are dotted syntax (example: cds.dest.application). Under the hood, if you use match operator it uses the Go regexp package, so you can use regular expressions that are supported in the Go regexp package.\nIf you add multiple basic run conditions, all of these must be satisfied to run the pipeline. So with basic conditions you can\u0026rsquo;t make an OR between multiple conditions, it\u0026rsquo;s always an AND. If you want to make more specific or advanced run conditions you have to use the second type of conditions (advanced).\nAdvanced run conditions If you want some advanced run conditions, like for example make some computation over specific variables and then compare their values, you have the ability to use advanced run conditions. In fact, you are free to make any computation or comparison because advanced condition is a Lua script that returns a boolean (true if you want to run the pipeline or false if you don\u0026rsquo;t). In this case the variables syntax is in Unix case (example: cds_dest_application) and prefixed with cds_, git_ or workflow_. In general, . or - in CDS variable name must be replaced with _. For example, if you have a variable named cds.build.my-variable then in Lua you have to use it as cds_build_my_variable.\nPay attention, all types of variables are string. Inside the Lua editor on CDS you have the autocompletion of your variables, you just have to write cds_, git_ or workflow_ to see suggestions. Please be aware that you can\u0026rsquo;t have at the same time basic conditions and advanced conditions. The behavior when you have both is that ONLY advanced run conditions will be effective.\nFor example if you want to launch the pipeline if the value of cds_status is Success and git_branch is master OR if the value of cds_manual is true you have to write:\n-- Pay attention! All variables value are string so you compare cds_manual with the string \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; and not true return cds_status == \u0026#34;Success\u0026#34; and (git_branch == \u0026#34;master\u0026#34; or cds_manual == \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;) Another use case is to enable auto-prod during working days only (not Saturday and Sunday):\nreturn os.date(\u0026#34;%w\u0026#34;) \u0026lt; \u0026#34;5\u0026#34; Or if you also want to block deployment on your production after 6pm:\nreturn os.date(\u0026#34;%w\u0026#34;) \u0026lt; \u0026#34;5\u0026#34; and os.date(\u0026#34;%H\u0026#34;) \u0026lt; \u0026#34;18\u0026#34; You can also use regular expression in your Lua condition, for instance:\n-- this example checks if current application beginning with \u0026#39;abc\u0026#39; -- don\u0026#39;t forget to import the regular expression module local re = require(\u0026#34;re\u0026#34;) return re.match(cds_application, \u0026#34;abc.*\u0026#34;) == cds_application Functions re.find, re.gsub, re.match, re.gmatch are available.

	"content": "The workflow concept is a key feature, and widely considered a native, manageable and feature-rich entity in CDS. A CDS Workflow allows you to chain pipelines with manual or automatic gates, using conditional branching. A workflow can be stored as code, designed on CDS UI, or both, depending on what best suits you.\nLet’s take an example. One workflow for building and deploying three micro-services:\n Build each micro-service Deploy them in preproduction Run integration tests on preproduction environment Deploy them in production, then re-run integration tests in production  For the building part, there is only one pipeline to manage, which is used three times in the workflow with a different application/environment context each time. This is called the pipeline context.\nAny conditional branching against the workflow (e.g.“automatic deployment on the staging environment, only if the current Git branch is master”) can be executed through a run conditional set on the pipeline.\nLet’s look at a a real use case. This is the workflow that builds, tests and deploys CDS in production at OVH (yes, CDS builds and deploys itself!):\n For each Git commit, the workflow is triggered The UI is packaged, all binaries are prepared, and the docker images are built. The “UT” job launches the unit tests. The “IT” job installs CDS in an ephemeral environment and launches the integration tests on it. Part 2 is automatically triggered on all Git commits. Part 3 deploys CDS on our preproduction environment, then launches the integration tests on it. It is started automatically when the current branch is the master branch. Last but not least, part 4 deploys CDS on our production environment.  If there is a failure on a pipeline, it may look like this:\nBut of course, you’re not limited to the most complex tasks with CDS Workflows! These two examples demonstrate the fact that workflows allow to build and deploy a coherent set of micro-services. If you have simpler needs, your workflows are, of course, simpler.\n"

	"content": "On a workflow you can have 2 kinds of notifications:\n User notifications: they are useful to notify users by email or with a message of an event on your workflow (success, fail, change, etc\u0026hellip;). Events: linked to event integrations to let you write microservices which can interact with these events plugged on your event integrations.  User notifications You can configure user notifications to send email with different parameters. Inside the body of the notification you can customise the message thanks to the CDS variable templating with syntax like {{.cds.myvar}}. You can also use HTML to customise the message, then in order to let CDS interpret your message as an HTML one you just need to wrap all your message inside html tag like this \u0026lt;html\u0026gt;MyContentHere\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;.\nVCS Notifications You can configure for which node in your workflow CDS have to send a status on your repository service provider (Github, Bitbucket, \u0026hellip;). You can configure if you want to have a comment on your pull-request when your workflow fails or you can just disable pull-request comment to only have status of your pipelines. By default you already have a default template for your pull-request comment but you can customize it with different kinds of templating. To have access about the node run data and write some loops and conditions you can use the standard syntax as the go templating but with [[ ]] delimitters. You can also use the CDS interpolation engine with the same syntax you already know and use inside pipelines, for example: {{.cds.workflow}} to get the name of the workflow.\nFor the go templating you have few variables you can use/iterate over.\n .Stages: an array of stages with .RunJobsinside which are the array of runned jobs with their .Name  .RunJobs: Inside a stage object which are the array of runned jobs  .Job.Action.Name: The name of the runned job .Job.Status: The status of runned job     .Tests: array of tests results  .Total: total number of tests .TotalOK: total number of OK tests .TotalKO: total number of KO tests .TotalSkipped: total number of skipped tests    If you need to know about other variable you can check WorkflowNodeRun data structure here.\nFor example by default the template of pull-request comment is:\n[[- if .Stages ]] CDS Report [[.WorkflowNodeName]]#[[.Number]].[[.SubNumber]] [[ if eq .Status \u0026quot;Success\u0026quot; -]] ✔ [[ else ]][[ if eq .Status \u0026quot;Fail\u0026quot; -]] ✘ [[ else ]][[ if eq .Status \u0026quot;Stopped\u0026quot; -]] ■ [[ else ]]- [[ end ]] [[ end ]] [[ end ]] [[- range $s := .Stages]] [[- if $s.RunJobs ]] * [[$s.Name]] [[- range $j := $s.RunJobs]] * [[$j.Job.Action.Name]] [[ if eq $j.Status \u0026quot;Success\u0026quot; -]] ✔ [[ else ]][[ if eq $j.Status \u0026quot;Fail\u0026quot; -]] ✘ [[ else ]][[ if eq $j.Status \u0026quot;Stopped\u0026quot; -]] ■ [[ else ]]- [[ end ]] [[ end ]] [[ end ]] [[- end]] [[- end]] [[- end]] [[- end]] [[- if .Tests ]] [[- if gt .Tests.TotalKO 0]] Unit Tests Report [[- range $ts := .Tests.TestSuites]] * [[ $ts.Name ]] [[range $tc := $ts.TestCases]] [[- if or ($tc.Errors) ($tc.Failures) ]] * [[ $tc.Name ]] ✘ [[- end]] [[end]] [[- end]] [[- end]] [[- end]] Which, for a pipeline with 1 stage and a job in failure, is displayed like this:\nCDS Report build#11.0 ✘ * Stage 1 * my job ✘ And displayed on GitHub:\nEvents If you need to trigger some specific actions on the technical side, like for example use a microservice which listens to all events in your workflow (updates, launch, stop, etc.), you can add an event integration like, for example, Kafka and listen to the kafka topic to trigger some actions on your side. Events are more like sending notifications to machines instead of user notifications which are made for users. The see structure of sent events, you can look here and here.\n"

	"content": "Purpose The goal of CDS is to start a worker when you need it, which should match all your requirements exactly. In order to scale automatically on demand, it is possible to register a worker model.\nThe goal of a worker model is to describe the capabilities of a given Docker/ISO image in terms of architecture, pre-installed binaries or libraries.\nTypes There are 4 types of worker models:\n Docker images, see how to create a worker model Docker OpenStack images, see how to create a worker model OpenStack vSphere images, see how to create a worker model vSphere Host worker model, which means workers launched on the same host as the hatchery. The security implication of such setup is lack of isolation between worker processes. They will share host resources like CPU, RAM, file system etc. For this reason, we don\u0026rsquo;t recommend using this model in production.  Behavior All registered CDS hatcheries start/kill workers as needed.\nAdd a worker model A user can add a worker model by setting an owner group if user is administrator of group.\nA CDS administrator can add a worker model, a worker model pattern and attach it to \u0026lsquo;shared.infra\u0026rsquo; group.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a worker model pattern? A pattern of scripts configuration of CDS workers that CDS administrator create to let users use this pattern when they want to create a worker model. For more information click here.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a restricted worker model? A shared.infra hatchery can launch all worker models, except \u0026lsquo;restricted\u0026rsquo; worker models.\nUse case: users can launch their own hatchery. To use their worker models only with their hatchery, they have to set worker model as \u0026lsquo;restricted\u0026rsquo;.\n"

	"content": "What is a workflow template? A workflow template is useful to easily create a new workflow for a project. Also if you need to manage multiple workflows, you can use a template to create one unique and generic workflow then apply it on each workflow.\nTemplates are versioned, so you can easily improve your template then re-apply it on a workflow.\nA template contains a workflow, pipelines, applications, environments in yaml format. Each yaml file of a template is evaluated as a Golang template (with [[ and ]] delimiters) so loop or condition can be used in templates.\nTemplate parameters There are four types of custom parameters available in a template (string, boolean, repository, json). There are some other parameters that are automatically added by CDS:\n name: the name of the generated workflow given when template is applied (could be used to set the workflow name but also application names for example). id: the id of the template instance, this is unique for each generated workflow and reused when a template is re-applied (you can append this value to pipeline names to prevent override of existing pipeline).  Apply a template To generate a new workflow from a template you should use the cdsctl. Then use the same command to update a generated workflow:\ncdsctl template apply You can also create a workflow from a template with the web UI. Bulk apply a template To generate or update multiple workflows from a same template in one time you can use the bulk feature. This works both in cdsctl and cds ui:\ncdsctl template bulk You can also use a file to list all test instances that you want to generate and the values for all the required parameters.\ntemplate_path: shared.infra/example-simple  instances: - workflow_path: DEMO/demo1  parameters: - withDeploy=true  - deployWhen=success  - workflow_path: DEMO/demo2  parameters: - withDeploy=false  - data=[\u0026#34;one\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;two\u0026#34;]  cdsctl template bulk -f instances.yml Import/Create/Export With cdsctl you can import/export a template from/to yaml files, you can also create a template in the UI from the settings menu:\ncdsctl template push ./my-template/*.yml #from local files cdsctl template push https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovh/cds/master/tests/fixtures/template/simple/example-simple.yml #from remote files cdsctl template pull shared.infra/my-template --output-dir ./my-template Delete/Change template group When removing a template, all info about the template and its instances are removed but all generated stuff will not be deleted. With the CDS UI you can change the template name or group, this will not affect template instances or generated workflow but no group members will be able to re-apply the template anymore.\nTemplate and workflow ascode You can both use a template and a workflow ascode. When using a template your repository will only contains one yaml file with the name of the template that you want to use and the values for all the required template parameters. You can create this file manually or directly with the CDS command line.\nname: demo from: shared.infra/example-with-repository@1 parameters: deployWhen: manual repo: gitlab/richardlt/demo ssh_key_name: proj-ssh-key withDeploy: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; You can ask for a specific revision of the template or remove the version number to always get the its latest version. This means that you can use different template versions for different branches of your repository. Also you can change the template reference to use another template on a specific branch.\n"

Maximum number of Workflow Runs. The maximum number of run to keep for the Workflow.  The dry run button allows you to test your lua expression. The result is a table filled with all runs that would be kept\nWorkflow run retention policy This feature is not currently enabled by default. However, you can try this feature on a CDS project using the feature flipping. To activate the feature you can create a file like the following:\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; workflow-retention-policy.yml name: workflow-retention-policy rule: return project_key == \u0026#34;KEY_FOR_PROJECT_THAT_YOU_WANT_TO_ACTIVATE\u0026#34; EOF cdsctl admin feature import workflow-retention-policy.yml  Retention policy is defined through a lua condition. This condition should be evaluated as true to keep a Workflow Run.\nYou will be able to use these variables in conditions:\n run_days_before (number): count of days between Workflow creation date and now. has_git_branch (string: true|false): True if a git.branch variable is set (added in 0.48.1). git_branch_exist (string: true|false): True if a git.branch variable is set and branch still exists on the git repository. run_status (string: Success|Fail|\u0026hellip;): the Workflow Run status. gerrit_change_merged (string: true|false): to identify if the gerrit change has been merged. gerrit_change_abandoned (string: true|false): to identify if the gerrit change has been abandoned. gerrit_change_days_before (number): to identify gerrit change older than x days. All other variables from the Workflow Run payload (ex: cds_triggered_by_username, git_branch\u0026hellip;).  Examples:\n-- Keep Run for 365 days return run_days_before \u0026lt; 365 -- Keep Run for 365 days if git_branch is set and exists in VCS or only 2 days for removed branches -- Else keep Run for 365 days if no git_branch info is set if(has_git_branch == \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;) then if(git_branch_exist == \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;) then return run_days_before \u0026lt; 365 else return run_days_before \u0026lt; 2 end else return run_days_before \u0026lt; 365 end -- Keep Run for ever return true Maximum number of Workflow Runs This feature is not currently enabled by default. However, you can try this feature on a CDS project using the feature flipping. To activate the feature you can create a file like the following:\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; workflow-retention-maxruns.yml name: workflow-retention-maxruns rule: return project_key == \u0026#34;KEY_FOR_PROJECT_THAT_YOU_WANT_TO_ACTIVATE\u0026#34; EOF cdsctl admin feature import workflow-retention-maxruns.yml  This value can be set only by a CDS administrator.

You can create something like:\n Virtual repository: myteam-docker Snapshot repository: myteam-docker-snapshot Release repository: myteam-docker-release  By using this convention, the CDS release action will be able to promote your artifacts from snapshot to release repositories\nHow to configure Artifactory integration on your project Link Artifactory to your project On the integration project view, add a new \u0026ldquo;Artifact Manager\u0026rdquo; integration and fill the following parameters:\n name: The name of the integration. platform: Must be \u0026lsquo;artifactory\u0026rsquo; url: URL of artifactory api (https//myinstance.ofartifactory/artifactory/) project.key: The name of the artifactory project (https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Projects) cds.repository: The name of the repository used by CDS to upload/download artifacts (must be a virtual repository) token.name: The name of the access token used by CDS to access the artifactory API token: The value of the access token used by CDS to access the artifactory API release.token: The value of the access token used by CDS to access the distribution API (https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Distribution) promotion.maturity.low: suffix used on your local repositories to identify your snapshots  Enable Artifactory integration on your workflow On the workflow advanced view, you can link your workflow to project integration.\nIntegration actions The artifactory integration comes with 5 actions: https://github.com/ovh/cds/tree/master/contrib/integrations/artifactory\nArtifactory-Upload-Artifact This plugin is used by CDS Upload Artifact action to send artifact into artifactory.\nThe artifacts will be stored in the cds repository provided during the integration configuration (cds.repository)\nArtifactory-Download-Artifact This plugin is used by CDS Download Artifact action to retrieve artifact from artifactory.\nThe artifacts will be downloaded from the cds repository provided during the integration configuration (cds.repository)\nArtifactory-Push-Build-Info This plugin is used by CDS Push Build Info action to create inside artifactory a build-info. JFrog documentation: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Build+Integration\nThis action must be run after all the artifacts have been uploaded.\nThe build name computed by CDS will be: [build.info.path]/[cds.projectkey]/[cds.workflow.name]\nArtifactory-Promote This plugin is used by CDS Promote action to move artifacts from 1 repository to another. The two repositories must share the name but having a different suffix.\nFor example:\n my-docker-repo-snapshot my-docker-repo-release  Artifactory-Release This plugin is used by CDS Release action.\nIt promotes the provided artifacts, creates a release bundle and distributes it to all edges.\nThis action uses both the artifactory and distribution APIs.\n"

See doc about stages \u0026amp; jobs inside a pipeline. A pipeline is started with a context: 0 or 1 application, 0 or 1 environment.\nWorkflow A Workflow makes it possible to chain the pipelines. This is a key Feature of CDS. You can create workflows using one or more pipelines, pipelines that can be linked together with joins or forks.\nYou can imagine having only one builder workflow and deploying your entire microservice stack. The same pipeline can be used several times in a workflow, you can associate an application, an environment. You will have only one deployment pipeline and only one build pipeline to maintain, even if you have hundreds of applications.\nWorkflow templates A workflow template allow to share and reuse workflows across multiple teams. Any user can create a Workflow Template, maintain it as code or from UI, and bulk update a set of workflows with a single action.\nAs a company, you can offer a predefined catalog of workflows allowing you to standardize test and deployment practices across all your teams.\nThis also reduces the maintenance efforts since templates allow a scalable centralized management.\nVisual configuration with Web UI You can configure everything with the web UI. Even if you have complex use cases, it\u0026rsquo;s usually easier to create your workflow graphically.\nConfiguration on Git Repository Pipeline as code is a well-known concept of CI / CD tools. CDS, goes a step further and offers workflow as code. This is done by git-pushing using yaml configuration files of your workflow (+ pipeline, + applications, + environment). This is partucularly useful as you can test your new workflow on a dev branch, before merging the changes on the master branch.\nConfiguration as code on UI You can modify your workflow with the UI, you can also modify the configuration by editing the yml directly in the UI if you wish. This is an excellent way to learn how to use the workflow-as-code feature.\nNative Git branching Ability to launch builds based on a branch pattern. This allows, for example, to deploy dev/* branches to \u0026ldquo;staging\u0026rdquo; and deploy the master branch to \u0026ldquo;prod\u0026rdquo;.\nNote that CDS\u0026rsquo;s default behavior is to launch the whole workflow on every git commit. This behavior can be altered using \u0026ldquo;run conditions\u0026rdquo;.\nNative GitHub / Bitbucket Server / GitLab / Gerrit integration 2-way integration with most popular git-based products.\n Ability to get notified and start a build when a change is pushed . Ability to notify the git-based tool of the success/failure of the build.  CDS natively supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Server and Gerrit. The link between your repo git and CDS is via a CDS application: 1 Git repository == a CDS application. Through this integration, CDS will push build status of your commits : Building, Success or Failed.\nMultiple VCS Support in Pipeline/Job CDS gives you the possibility to clone from different git repositories within a single workflow. A CDS workflow can involve several different applications - or none if you do not want to have a connection with a git repo.\nJob\u0026rsquo;s Services Ability to start ephemeral services (a database, a web server, etc.) to support your job. This is particularly handy while testing your code.\nIn CDS these services are called Service Prerequisites. You just need to specify the corresponding docker image and run params.\nTake a simple example: you have a pipeline that builds a docker image containing your application. Your application needs a redis and a postgreSQL to work. You can in a CDS job put three prerequisites service: a redis, a postgreSQL and your application. CDS will take care of making a private network between its services so that they can communicate with each other. Your CDS job can thus perform integration tests on your application started with a real database and a real cache.\nPlease read: https://ovh.github.io/cds/workflows/pipelines/requirements/service/\nSecure Remote Caching A remote cache is used by a team of developers and/or a continuous integration (CI) system to share build outputs. If your build is reproducible, the outputs from one machine can be safely reused on another machine, which can make builds significantly faster\nDoc: https://ovh.github.io/cds/docs/components/worker/cache/\nEnterprise Notification Bus As an Enterprise-Grade platform, CDS can send a wide range of its internal events (e.g. build finished) in an event bus. This event flow can then feed other services (reporting, notifications, etc., ).\nBuilt-in Hooks Ability to launch a workflow manually or with git pushes or via a scheduler or via a webhook. In addition to the above, CDS can also be triggered using an event bus to (kafka or RabbitMQ).\nContinuous Deployment \u0026amp; Environment Support Ability to manage multiple environments (e.g. dev/prod/staging) in a secure way with segregated access rights. In practice, an environment is a just set of variables that you can use within your workflows.\nWith CDS, You can use a deployment pipeline on your preproduction environment and use that same deployment pipeline on your production environment. The ability to deploy to production can be limited to a pre-established group of users.\nEnterprise-grade permissions / Support of ACLs delegation Users are free to create groups and manage users in their groups. A group can have the rights to read, write, execute on their projects and their workflows. You can also restrict the execution of some pipelines to some groups if you wish.\nBuild Artifacts Cloud If you use CDS as a CI / CD tool, you will probably have built artifacts. CDS jobs are isolated from each other, but you can pass artifacts from one job to another using the Artifact Upload and Artifact Download actions. At the end of a CDS job, all the files are deleted from the workers. To persist artifacts, CDS can use a Swift Storage or on a given filesystem (not recommended though).\nTests \u0026amp; Vulnerabilities Reports CDS clearly displays the results of unit tests and vulnerabilities detected during builds.\nSelf-Service Project Creation A CDS project is like a tenant. All users can create a CDS project, this project will bring together applications, environments, pipelines and of course workflows.\nCDS projects are isolated from one another, but the same group may have access rights to multiple projects if you wish.\nExecution Environment Customization A worker model is a worker execution context. Let\u0026rsquo;s say, you need to run a job that requires GoLang v1.11.5. In CDS, you just need to create a Go worker model, containing a go in version 1.11.5. A worker model can be a docker image, an openstack image, a VSphere image. Although CDS administrators can offer shared worker models, users can create their own template workers if they wish.\nSelf Service User’s Integrations On a CDS project, you can add integrations like openstack, kubernetes, etc \u0026hellip;. This will offer you features within your workflows. For example, with the Kubernetes integration, you can add your own cluster to your CDS project and thus be able to use the Deploy Application action to deploy your newly built application on your cluster, in helm format if you wish. You can of course develop your own integrations.\nMulti-Tenancy After reading the previous points, you\u0026rsquo;ve understood: self-service everywhere. All users can do their project / workflow / worker models / workflow templates / actions \u0026hellip; And run Jobs in a totally isolated environment. CDS projects are builders, on which you can add integrations. All this allows you to have only one instance of CDS for your entire company.\nCommand Line Interface (cdsctl): 100% features supported All you can do with the UI is available via the Command-Line Interface (CLI), named \u0026ldquo;cdsctl\u0026rdquo;. cdsctl is available on all the OS: darwin, freebsd, linux, openbsd \u0026hellip; cdsctl will allow you to create, launch, export, import your workflows, monitor your CDS, navigate through your projects, workflows. No need to go to the UI of CDS or your repository manager to check the status of your commit, git push \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cdsctl workflow --track will display your workflow in your command line.\nREST API \u0026amp; SDK Do you have even more advanced automation needs, or the desire to develop an application that queries CDS? the REST API and the SDK will allow you to easily develop your software.\nCDS Administration features Self-Hosting CDS is open-source since October 2016. You can install it freely in your company or at home. Some tutorials are available to help you start a CDS, docker-compose, Kubernetes with Helm, Install with binaries.\nHigh Availability / Scalability / Upgrade without User Downtime High availability is a very important point for a CI / CD tool. CDS is stateless, nothing is stored on the filesystem. This makes it possible to launch several CDS APIs behind a load balancer. Thus, you can scale the API of CDS to your needs. It also allows upgrades of CDS in full day without impact for users. In production @OVH, CDS can be updated several times a day, without impacting users or stopping CDS workers. Asking your users to stop working while updating the Continuous Delivery tool would be ironic, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? ;-)\nBuilt-in Metrics CDS natively exposes monitoring data. You will be able to feed your instance prometheus or warp10 using beamium.\nExtensibility Plugins A CDS job consists of steps. Each step is a built-in type action (script, checkoutApplication, Artifact upload / download \u0026hellip;). You can create your own actions, using existing actions - or develop your own action as a plugin. All languages are supported, as long as the language supports GRPC.\nOS/Arch Compatibility CDS is agnostic to languages and platforms. Users can launch Jobs on linux, windows, freebsd, osx, raspberry \u0026hellip; in Virtual Machine spawn on demand, in a docker container, on a dedicated host.\nSo, if your company uses multiple technologies, CDS will not be a blocker for building and deploying your internal software.\nAuto-Scale OnDemand multi-cloud One of the initial objectives of CDS at OVH: builder and deploy 150 applications as a container in less than 7 minutes. This has become reality since 2015. What is the secret key? Auto-Scale on Demand!\nThus, you can have hundreds of workers model and when necessary, CDS will start the workers using the hatcheries.\nA hatchery is like an incubator, it gives birth to the CDS Workers and the right of life and death over them.\nSeveral types of hatchery are available:\n hatchery kubernetes starts workers in pods hatchery openstack starts virtual machines hatchery swarm starts docker containers hatchery marathon starts docker containers hatchery VSphere starts virtual machines hatchery local starts processes on a host  So yes, buzzwords or not, a multi-cloud Auto-scale OnDemand is a reality with CDS :-)\nSome explanations on the comparison matrix  *1 Impossible if you create your pipeline with Pipeline plugin, force usage of jenkinsfile *2 There is the Pipeline plugin, but not compatible with Graphical Configuration with ui, Git branching, and repository manager integration. *3 Multi-branch pipeline plugin - but incompatible Pipeline plugin *4 Job Cacher plugin not compatible with Blue Ocean, MultiBranch Pipeline, Pipeline plugin, but not compatible with Swift Storage *5 \u0026ldquo;The current version of this plugin may not be safe to use. \u0026quot; https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/EnvInject+Plugin *6 https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/security/#authorization *7 it\u0026rsquo;s not builtin, it\u0026rsquo;s JCloud plugin *8 Vulnerability report not available on CE Edition *9 everything is in the same bucket *10 docker only *11 explained on https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/multi-tenancy-jenkins *12 https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/ *13 Upgrade Gitlab can be on several days https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/ *14 it\u0026rsquo;s a plugin *15 K8s, Docker machine \u0026amp; GKE only *16 limited to about 150 executors https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/multi-tenancy-jenkins(§Scale) *17 Only in Silver and Premium Gitlab Edition https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#trigger-premium    "

	"content": "   Elastic CDS resources/workers are launched on demand, to guarantee low waiting times for users, with no over-consumption of idle resources\n    Extensible In CDS, any kind of action (Kubernetes and OpenStack deployments, pushing to Kafka, testing for CVEs…) can be captured in high-level plugins, to be used as building blocks by users. These plugins are straightforward to write and use, so it’s easy to meet the most exotic needs in an effective and stress-free way.\n    Flexible, but easy CDS can run complex workflows, with all sorts of intermediary steps, including build, test, deploy 1/10/100, manual or automatic gates, rollback, conditional branches… These workflows can be stored as code in the git repository. CDS provides basic workflow templates for the Core team’s most common scenarios, in order to ease the adoption process. This way, building a functional CI/CD chain from nothing can be quick and easy.\n    Self-service Finally, a key aspect is the idea of self-service. Once a CDS project is created by users, they are completely autonomous within that space, with the freedom to manage pipelines, delegate access rights etc. All users are free to customise their space as they see fit, and build on what is provided out-of-the-box. Personalising workflow templates, plugins, running build and tests on custom VM flavors or custom hardware… all this can be done without any intervention from the CDS administrators.\n    Clearly visualize your workflow CDS provides an intuitive UI that allows you to build complex workflows, run them and dig into the logs when needed.    The most powerful Command Line for a CI/CD Platform cdsctl is the CDS Command Line - you can script everything with it, cdsctl also provide some cool commands such as cdsctl shell to browse your projects and workflows without the need to open a browser.

You can put #!/bin/bash, or #!/bin/perl at first line. Make sure that the binary used is in the pre-requisites of action.  Requirements No Requirement\nYAML example Example of a pipeline using Script action:\nversion: v1.0 name: Pipeline1 stages: - Stage1 jobs: - job: Job1 stage: Stage1 steps: - script: - \u0026#39;#!/bin/sh\u0026#39; - echo \u0026#34;{{.cds.application}}\u0026#34; Using CDS variables in a script You can use CDS Variables in a step script.\nUsing CDS keys in a script You can use CDS SSH keys and PGP keys in a step script with the worker key command. Just use worker key install proj-mykey and it will install the SSH/PGP environment and private SSH/PGP key of your key in your project named mykey.\nThe command worker key install proj-mykey will return the path where the private key is stored. In that way you can save this value in a variable and use it for a ssh command like this:\nPKEY=`worker key install proj-mykey` ssh -i $PKEY myuser@myhost echo \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; #PKEY only works with SSH key Pay attention, to use a PGP key, please add in your pipeline requirements the binary named gpg.\nUsing worker CLI in a script You can use worker CLI to make different actions\n worker artifacts worker download worker export worker tag worker cache worker tmpl worker key  Example  Job Configuration, a step with perl, another with bash   Launch pipeline, check logs  Notes Make sure that the binary used is in the pre-requisites of the action.\nIf you use a shebang bash, sh, zsh or ksh, CDS will return a failure on your step if an executed command fails.\nIf you want to control command\u0026rsquo;s exit code, you have to add\nset +e Below is an example of a step that will fail at the first line:\nwhich a-unknown-binary # Step will fail here, lines below won\u0026#39;t be executed if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo \u0026#34;binary a-unknown-binary does not exists\u0026#34;; # this won\u0026#39;t be displayed exit 1 fi; exit 0 If you want to display an error message before exiting, you should rather use:\nset +e which a-unknown-binary if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo \u0026#34;binary a-unknown-binary does not exists\u0026#34;; # this will be displayed exit 1 fi; exit 0 "

So first you have to create a DHCP server on your host with NAT if you want to access to the internet. In order to create you have multiple possibilities like create your own VM with a DHCP server configured or if you are comfortable with the VMware tools you can use the NSX system. This system will create DHCP gateway for you.\nAlso we recommend you to create a VM base that the hatchery will use to linked clone your new VM to execute your jobs. For example in our case we create different VM base with a minimal debian installed in different versions. In order to save your host resources we advice you to turn these VMs off.\nStart vSphere hatchery Generate a token:\n$ cdsctl consumer new me \\ --scopes=Hatchery,RunExecution,Service,WorkerModel \\ --name=\u0026#34;hatchery.vsphere\u0026#34; \\ --description=\u0026#34;Consumer token for vsphere hatchery\u0026#34; \\ --groups=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \\ --no-interactive Builtin consumer successfully created, use the following token to sign in: xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.4Bd9XJMIWrfe8Lwb-Au68TKUqflPorY2Fmcuw5vIoUs5gQyCLuxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Edit the section hatchery.vsphere in the CDS Configuration file.
