# Mesos/Marathon Deployment

This action helps you to deploy on Mesos/Marathon. Provide a marathon.json file to configure deployment.

Your marathon.json file can be templated with cds variables `{{.cds.variables}}`.

Enable `waitForDeployment` option to ensure deployment is successfull.

Enable `insecureSkipVerify` option if you want to use self-signed certificate.
