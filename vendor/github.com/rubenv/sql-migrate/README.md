# sql-migrate

> SQL Schema migration tool for [Go](http://golang.org/). Based on [gorp](https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp) and [goose](https://bitbucket.org/liamstask/goose).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/sql-migrate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/sql-migrate) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate)

Using [modl](https://github.com/jmoiron/modl)? Check out [modl-migrate](https://github.com/rubenv/modl-migrate).

## Features

* Usable as a CLI tool or as a library
* Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL and Oracle databases (through [gorp](https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp))
* Can embed migrations into your application
* Migrations are defined with SQL for full flexibility
* Atomic migrations
* Up/down migrations to allow rollback
* Supports multiple database types in one project

## Installation

To install the library and command line program, use the following:

```bash
go get github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate/...
```

## Usage
### As a standalone tool
```
$ sql-migrate --help
usage: sql-migrate [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]

Available commands are:
    down      Undo a database migration
    redo      Reapply the last migration
    status    Show migration status
    up        Migrates the database to the most recent version available
```

Each command requires a configuration file (which defaults to `dbconfig.yml`, but can be specified with the `-config` flag). This config file should specify one or more environments:

```yml
development:
    dialect: sqlite3
    datasource: test.db
    dir: migrations/sqlite3

production:
    dialect: postgres
    datasource: dbname=myapp sslmode=disable
    dir: migrations/postgres
    table: migrations
```

The `table` setting is optional and will default to `gorp_migrations`.

The environment that will be used can be specified with the `-env` flag (defaults to `development`).

Use the `--help` flag in combination with any of the commands to get an overview of its usage:

```
$ sql-migrate up --help
Usage: sql-migrate up [options] ...

  Migrates the database to the most recent version available.

Options:

  -config=config.yml   Configuration file to use.
  -env="development"   Environment.
  -limit=0             Limit the number of migrations (0 = unlimited).
  -dryrun              Don't apply migrations, just print them.
```

The `up` command applies all available migrations. By contrast, `down` will only apply one migration by default. This behavior can be changed for both by using the `-limit` parameter.

The `redo` command will unapply the last migration and reapply it. This is useful during development, when you're writing migrations.

Use the `status` command to see the state of the applied migrations:

```bash
$ sql-migrate status
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+
|   MIGRATION   |                 APPLIED                 |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 1_initial.sql | 2014-09-13 08:19:06.788354925 +0000 UTC |
| 2_record.sql  | no                                      |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+
```

### As a library
Import sql-migrate into your application:

```go
import "github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate"
```

Set up a source of migrations, this can be from memory, from a set of files or from bindata (more on that later):

```go
// Hardcoded strings in memory:
migrations := &migrate.MemoryMigrationSource{
    Migrations: []*migrate.Migration{
        &migrate.Migration{
            Id:   "123",
            Up:   []string{"CREATE TABLE people (id int)"},
            Down: []string{"DROP TABLE people"},
        },
    },
}

// OR: Read migrations from a folder:
migrations := &migrate.FileMigrationSource{
    Dir: "db/migrations",
}

// OR: Use migrations from bindata:
migrations := &migrate.AssetMigrationSource{
    Asset:    Asset,
    AssetDir: AssetDir,
    Dir:      "migrations",
}
```

Then use the `Exec` function to upgrade your database:

```go
db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", filename)
if err != nil {
    // Handle errors!
}

n, err := migrate.Exec(db, "sqlite3", migrations, migrate.Up)
if err != nil {
    // Handle errors!
}
fmt.Printf("Applied %d migrations!\n", n)
```

Note that `n` can be greater than `0` even if there is an error: any migration that succeeded will remain applied even if a later one fails.

Check [the GoDoc reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate) for the full documentation.

## Writing migrations
Migrations are defined in SQL files, which contain a set of SQL statements. Special comments are used to distinguish up and down migrations.

```sql
-- +migrate Up
-- SQL in section 'Up' is executed when this migration is applied
CREATE TABLE people (id int);


-- +migrate Down
-- SQL section 'Down' is executed when this migration is rolled back
DROP TABLE people;
```

You can put multiple statements in each block, as long as you end them with a semicolon (`;`).

If you have complex statements which contain semicolons, use `StatementBegin` and `StatementEnd` to indicate boundaries:

```sql
-- +migrate Up
CREATE TABLE people (id int);

-- +migrate StatementBegin
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION do_something()
returns void AS $$
DECLARE
  create_query text;
BEGIN
  -- Do something here
END;
$$
language plpgsql;
-- +migrate StatementEnd

-- +migrate Down
DROP FUNCTION do_something();
DROP TABLE people;
```

The order in which migrations are applied is defined through the filename: sql-migrate will sort migrations based on their name. It's recommended to use an increasing version number or a timestamp as the first part of the filename.

## Embedding migrations with [bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata)
If you like your Go applications self-contained (that is: a single binary): use [bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) to embed the migration files.

Just write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.

Then use bindata to generate a `.go` file with the migrations embedded:

```bash
go-bindata -pkg myapp -o bindata.go db/migrations/
```

The resulting `bindata.go` file will contain your migrations. Remember to regenerate your `bindata.go` file whenever you add/modify a migration (`go generate` will help here, once it arrives).

Use the `AssetMigrationSource` in your application to find the migrations:

```go
migrations := &migrate.AssetMigrationSource{
    Asset:    Asset,
    AssetDir: AssetDir,
    Dir:      "db/migrations",
}
```

Both `Asset` and `AssetDir` are functions provided by bindata.

Then proceed as usual.

## Extending
Adding a new migration source means implementing `MigrationSource`.

```go
type MigrationSource interface {
    FindMigrations() ([]*Migration, error)
}
```

The resulting slice of migrations will be executed in the given order, so it should usually be sorted by the `Id` field.
