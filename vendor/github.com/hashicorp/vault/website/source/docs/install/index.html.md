# Overview

Installing and upgrading Vault is generally simple. Please use the links in
this section to get a general overview of each process.

If you are upgrading, please ensure that you read the version-specific upgrade
notes! Although we strive for minimal breaking changes, they do happen, and
reading the upgrade notes will ensure that you are adequately prepared for the
upgrade.
