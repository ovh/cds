# Your First Secret

Now that the dev server is up and running, let's get straight to it and
read and write our first secret.

One of the core features of Vault is the ability to read and write
arbitrary secrets securely. On this page, we'll do this using the CLI,
but there is also a complete
[HTTP API](/docs/http/index.html)
that can be used to programmatically do anything with Vault.

Secrets written to Vault are encrypted and then written to backend
storage. For our dev server, backend storage is in-memory, but in production
this would more likely be on disk or in [Consul](https://www.consul.io).
Vault encrypts the value before it is ever handed to the storage driver.
The backend storage mechanism _never_ sees the unencrypted value and doesn't
have the means necessary to decrypt it without Vault.

## Writing a Secret

Let's start by writing a secret. This is done very simply with the
`vault write` command, as shown below:

```
$ vault write secret/hello value=world
Success! Data written to: secret/hello
```

This writes the pair `value=world` to the path `secret/hello`. We'll
cover paths in more detail later, but for now it is important that the
path is prefixed with `secret/`, otherwise this example won't work. The
`secret/` prefix is where arbitrary secrets can be read and written.

You can even write multiple pieces of data, if you want:

```
$ vault write secret/hello value=world excited=yes
Success! Data written to: secret/hello
```

`vault write` is a very powerful command. In addition to writing data
directly from the command-line, it can read values and key pairs from
`STDIN` as well as files. For more information, see the
[vault write documentation](/docs/commands/read-write.html).

~> **Warning:** The documentation uses the `key=value` based entry
throughout, but it is more secure to use files if possible. Sending
data via the CLI is often logged in shell history. For real secrets,
please use files. See the link above about reading in from `STDIN` for more information.

## Reading a Secret

As you might expect, secrets can be read with `vault read`:

```
$ vault read secret/hello
Key             	Value
---             	-----
refresh_interval	768h0m0s
excited         	yes
value           	world
```

As you can see, the values we wrote are given back to us. Vault reads
the data from storage and decrypts it.

The output format is purposefully whitespace separated to make it easy
to pipe into a tool like `awk`.

In addition to the tabular format, if you're working with machines or
a tool like `jq`, you can output the data in JSON format:

```
$ vault read -format=json secret/hello
{
	"request_id": "68315073-6658-e3ff-2da7-67939fb91bbd",
	"lease_id": "",
	"lease_duration": 2764800,
	"renewable": false,
	"data": {
		"excited": "yes",
		"value": "world"
	},
	"warnings": null
}
```

This contains some extra information; many backends create leases for secrets
that allow time-limited access to other systems, and in those cases `lease_id` would
contain a lease identifier and `lease_duration` would contain the length of time
for which the lease is valid, in seconds.

You can see our data mirrored
here as well. The JSON output is very useful for scripts. For example below
we use the `jq` tool to extract the value of the `excited` secret:

```
$ vault read -format=json secret/hello | jq -r .data.excited
yes
```

## Deleting a Secret

Now that we've learned how to read and write a secret, let's go ahead
and delete it. We can do this with `vault delete`:

```
$ vault delete secret/hello
Success! Deleted 'secret/hello' if it existed.
```

## Next

In this section we learned how to use the powerful CRUD features of
Vault to store arbitrary secrets. On its own this is already a useful
but basic feature.

Next, we'll learn the basics about [secret backends](/intro/getting-started/secret-backends.html).
