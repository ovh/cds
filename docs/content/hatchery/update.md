### Manual Update

If you run manually a Hatchery, you probably want to update it when CDS Engine is updated with a new release.

Update your hatchery from CDS API:

```bash
./engine update --api https://your.cds.instance
```

Update your hatchery from latest Release from GitHub:

```bash
./engine update --from-github
```
