CDS is composed of two binaries: `engine` and `worker`, you can find them on [CDS Releases](https://github.com/ovh/cds/releases/latest) for your os/architecture.

- `worker` is the binary used to run a CDS Job.
- `engine` is the binary used to run all CDS µServices.


# CDS µServices

A CDS µService is a process that can be launch by the `engine` binary.

- **api**: this is the main µService. 
  - Each `api` must shared the same PostgreSQL and redis databases. All other CDS µServices have to communicate with `api`.
  - The database user does not need to have the admin rights to create / alter tables.
- **ui**: the `ui` service serves the CDS UI static files.
  - It's the only service that can be accessed by end users. 
  - http path: `/cdsapi` - proxypass to reach CDS API.
  - http path: `/cdshooks` - proxypass that can be used by some external integrations or webhooks.
- **hooks**: this service manages [Hooks]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/workflow/hooks/_index.md">}}). 
  - You can multi-instanciate this service, it uses a redis to synchronize all tasks over all instances.
  - Users and some integrations need to send HTTP requests to this service, you can use the proxypass `/cdshooks` on the CDS UI to reach this service.
- **vcs**: The aim of this µService is to communicate with Repository Manager as [GitHub]({{< relref "/docs/integrations/github.md" >}}), [GitLab]({{< relref "/docs/integrations/gitlab.md" >}}), [Bitbucket]({{< relref "/docs/integrations/bitbucket.md" >}})... 
  - You can multi-instanciate this service, a redis is used to synchronize tasks over all instances.
- **repositories**: this µService is used to enable the as-code feature. 
  - Users can store CDS Files on their repositories. This service clones user repositories on local filesystem. 
  - You can't multi-instanciate this service for now.
- **elasticsearch**: user timeline and vulnerabilities computed are stored on a elasticsearch through this µService. 
  - It's optional unless you want theses features activated on your CDS.
- **hatchery:local**: the local hatchery spawns CDS Workers locally.
  - All workers shares the same filesystem.
  - Not recommanded for production with `shared.infra` group
- **hatchery:swarm**: the swarm hatchery spawn CDS Workers with docker. 
  - A single process of `hatchery:swarm` can managed many docker daemons. 
  - You can use [Service Requirement]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/requirement/requirement_service.md" >}}) with this hatchery. 
  - This hatchery uses the [worker model](https://ovh.github.io/cds/docs/concepts/worker-model/) docker.
- **hatchery:openstack**: the openstack hatchery creates Virtual Machine with a CDS Worker inside. 
  - This hatchery uses the [worker model](https://ovh.github.io/cds/docs/concepts/worker-model/) openstack.
- **hatchery:kubernetes**: the kubernetes hatchery creates a CDS Worker inside a Pod. 
  - You can use [Service Requirement]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/requirement/requirement_service.md" >}}) with this hatchery. 
  - This hatchery uses the [worker model](https://ovh.github.io/cds/docs/concepts/worker-model/) docker.
- **hatchery:marathon**: the marathon hatchery run CDS Worker as a marathon application. 
  - This hatchery uses the [worker model](https://ovh.github.io/cds/docs/concepts/worker-model/) docker.
- **hatchery:vsphere**: the vSphere hatchery creates Virtual Machine with a CDS Worker inside. 
  - This hatchery uses the [worker model](https://ovh.github.io/cds/docs/concepts/worker-model/) vsphere.
- **migrate**: this µService is used to run database migrations to upgrade your CDS Installation.
  - The configuration needs a postgreSQL user with rights to create / alter tables on postgreSQL.

# Single Process

With a single CDS Engine process, you can run all µServices. This is very convenient for testing CDS locally but it's not recommanded for a production installation.

# Multi-Processes

The binary engine can be used to launch in different processes each µService. This is recommanded for a production installation.

Each µService can be multi-instanciated, example:

- 6x `$engine start api`, each api shared the same PostgreSQL and redis.
- 3x `$engine start hooks`, each hooks shared the same redis.
- 3x `$engine start vcs`, each hooks shared the same redis.
- 3x `$engine start elasticsearch`.
- 1x `$engine start repositories`.

# RAM resources needed

Example of an installation for a production with 18.000 jobs launched per day:

- 6x `$engine start api`
  - RAM: 3Go per instance
  - Redis: 128Mo
- 3x `$engine start hooks`
  - RAM: 256Mo per instance
  - Redis: 256Mo
- 3x `$engine start vcs`
  - RAM: 256Mo per instance
  - Redis: 256Mo
- 3x `$engine start elasticsearch`
  - RAM: 256Mo per instance
- 1x `$engine start repositories`
  - RAM: 256Mo per instance
- 3x `$engine start ui`
  - RAM: 128Mo per instance
- 3x `$engine start migrate`
  - RAM: 128Mo per instance
- hatcheries: 256Mo per instance
