{{% feature image="elastic" %}}
#### Elastic

CDS resources/workers are launched on demand, to guarantee low waiting times for users, with no over-consumption of idle resources

#### Extensible
In CDS, any kind of action (Kubernetes and OpenStack deployments, pushing to Kafka, testing for CVEs…) can be captured in high-level plugins, to be used as building blocks by users. These plugins are straightforward to write and use, so it’s easy to meet the most exotic needs in an effective and stress-free way.

#### Flexible, but easy

CDS can run complex workflows, with all sorts of intermediary steps, including build, test, deploy 1/10/100, manual or automatic gates, rollback, conditional branches… These workflows can be stored as code in the git repository. CDS provides basic workflow templates for the Core team’s most common scenarios, in order to ease the adoption process. This way, building a functional CI/CD chain from nothing can be quick and easy.

{{% feature image="selfservice" %}}
####  Self-service

Finally, a key aspect is the idea of self-service. Once a CDS project is created by users,
they are completely autonomous within that space, with the freedom to manage pipelines,
delegate access rights etc. All users are free to customise their space as they see fit,
and build on what is provided out-of-the-box. Personalising workflow templates, plugins,
running build and tests on custom VM flavors or custom hardware… all this can be done without
any intervention from the CDS administrators.
