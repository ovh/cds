## What is a workflow template?
A workflow template is useful to easily create a new workflow for a project. Also if you need to manage multiple workflows, you can 
use a template to create one unique and generic workflow then apply it on each workflow.

Templates are versioned, so you can easily improve your template then re-apply it on a workflow.

A template contains a workflow, pipelines, applications, environments in yaml format.
Each yaml file of a template is evaluated as a Golang template (with [[ and ]] delimiters) so loop or condition can be used in templates.

## Template parameters
There are three types of custom parameters available in a template (string, boolean, repository).

There are some others parameters that are automatically added by CDS:

* **name**: the name of the generated workflow given when template is applied (could be used to set the workflow name but also application names for example).
* **id**: the id of the template instance, this is unique for each generated workflow and reused when a template is re-applied (you can append this value to pipeline names to prevent override of existing pipeline).

## Apply a template
To generate a new workflow from a template you should use the cdsctl. Then use the same command to update a generated workflow:
```sh
cdsctl template apply
```
<asciinema-player src="/images/workflow_template_apply.cast" cols="100" rows="25" autoplay="true" loop="true"></asciinema-player>

You can also create a workflow from a template with the web UI.

## Import/Create/Export
With cdsctl you can import/export a template from/to yaml files with cdsctl, you can also create a template in the ui from **settings** menu:
```sh
cdsctl template push ./my-template/*.yml #from local files
cdsctl template push https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovh/cds/master/tests/fixtures/template/simple/example-simple.yml #from remote files

cdsctl template pull shared.infra/my-template --output-dir ./my-template
```
<asciinema-player src="/images/workflow_template_pull_push.cast" cols="100" rows="25" autoplay="true" loop="true"></asciinema-player>

## Delete/Change template group
When removing a template, all info about the template and its instances are removed but all generated stuff will not be deleted.
With the CDS ui you can change the template name or group, this will not affect template instances or generated workflow but no group members will not be able to re-apply the template anymore.
