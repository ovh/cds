**CheckoutApplication** is a builtin action, you can't modify it.

This action clones a repository into a directory. If you want to clone a tag from your repository in this way, in your workflow payload you can add a key in your JSON like `"git.tag": "0.2"`.

This will run git clone with the following options:

- `--depth 50`
- `--recursive`
- authentication from Application VCS Strategy (ssh or http(s))

If you want to modify options `depth` or `recursive`, you have to use [GitClone action]({{< relref "gitclone.md" >}}).

## Parameters

* directory - optional - the name of a directory to clone into.
