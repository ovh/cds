Within a [Job]({{< relref "introduction/concepts/job.md" >}}), each [step]({{< relref "introduction/concepts/job.md" >}}) is based on an action.

There are three types of actions:

* [Built-in]({{< relref "workflows/pipelines/actions/builtin/_index.md" >}}) actions, available on each CDS Installation
* [User actions]({{< relref "workflows/pipelines/actions/user-actions/_index.md" >}}), added by CDS Administrators for now
* [Plugins actions]({{< relref "workflows/pipelines/actions/plugins/_index.md" >}}), added by CDS Administrators
