You want to run a workflow from a kafka message? This kind of hook is for you.

This kind of hook will connect to a kafka topic and consume message. For each message, it will trigger your workflow.

You have to:

* link your project to a Kafka platform, on Advanced Section.
* add a Kafka hook on the root pipeline of your workflow

The kafka message will be used as a payload for your workflow [See playload documentation]({{< relref "workflows/design/payload.md" >}}).
