On a Root Pipeline, you can add a "Webhook". Click on the created icon to get the WebHook URL.

In order to trigger this one you just have to make a HTTP call on the given URL with the selected method. If the selected method is `POST` you can also send a payload from your workflow inside the request body or if you use `GET` method you can write your payload using query parameters.

Example of curl:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"git.branch":"development"}'  https://cds.localhost.local/hook/webhook/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

In this example, https://cds.localhost.local/hook/ is your CDS Hooks ÂµService.
