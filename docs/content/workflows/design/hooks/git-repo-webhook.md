You want to run a workflow after a git push on a repository? This kind of hook is for you.

You have to:

* link your project to a Repository Manager, on Advanced Section. [See how to setup repository manager on your CDS instance]({{< relref "hosting/repositories-manager/_index.md" >}}).
* link an application to a git repository
* add a Repository Webhook on the root pipeline, this pipeline have the application linked in the [context]({{< relref "workflows/design/pipeline-context.md" >}})

GitHub / Bitbucket / GitLab are supported by CDS.
