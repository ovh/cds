A CDS Workflow can be launched:

* manually, user can enter a Payload
* by webhooks / repository webhooks, payload contains the value sent by initiator of the hook
* scheduler, the payload contains the value of the default payload. You can edit the default payload on the root pipeline
* (on roadmap) listener, as a Kafka listener. The payload will contain the content of the Kafka message

A payload is a JSON value. You can use it inside your CDS Jobs.

Example:

```json
{
  "akey": "valueOfKey",
  "subkey": {
    "akey": "value"
  }
}
```

Two variables are available inside your jobs:

```json
{{.akey}}
```

and

```json
{{.subkey.akey}}
```

On a `git.branch` attribute, you can choose a git branch **if you attach on the pipeline context an application linked to a Git Repository**.
