You want to run a workflow after a git push on a repository? This kind of hook is for you.

You have to:

* link your project to a Repository Manager, on Advanced Section
* link an application to a git repository
* add a Repository Webhook on the root pipeline, this pipeline have the application linked in the [context]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/workflow/pipeline-context.md" >}})

GitHub / Bitbucket / GitLab are supported by CDS.

> When you add a repository webhook, it will also automatically delete your runs which are linked to a deleted branch (24h after branch deletion).
