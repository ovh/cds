# Description
We introduce a new permission system using Role-based Access Control (RBAC).

It's on an experimental state as it doesn't manage all CDS resources for now.

You will be able to manage permission on all your ascode CDS resources. 

For example, if a user update you workflow files on your repository but he doesn't have the permission to do that in CDS, its changes will be ignored

# Prerequisites

* You must signed your commit to be able to update an ascode resources ( workflow, action worker-model etc..).
* You must add your gpg public key in CDS using [cdsctl]({{< relref "/docs/components/cdsctl/user/gpg/import" >}})

# Managed resources

Global CDS configuration:

* Organization
* Region
* Permission management
* Project Creation
* Hatchery

Project resources:
* Worker Model
