{{< note >}}
If you want to specify an image using a private registry or a private image, you need to fill credentials in field `username` and `password` to access your image. And if your image is not on docker hub but from a private registry, you need to fill the `registry` info (the registry api url, for example for docker hub it's https://index.docker.io/v1/ but we fill it by default).
