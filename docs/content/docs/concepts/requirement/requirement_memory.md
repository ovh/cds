The Memory requirement allows you to require a worker to have a specific number of mb of RAM.

For example if you need 2Gb of RAM for your worker you can put `2048` in your memory requirement.

*A [provisioned worker]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/worker-model/_index.md#what-s-workers-provisioning" >}}) can't be used by a job with a prerequisite memory*
