**GitClone** is a builtin action, you can't modify it.

Clone a repository into a new directory.

## Parameters

* **branch**: (optional) Instead of pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed to by the cloned repositoryâ€™s HEAD, point to {{.git.branch}} branch instead.
* **commit**: (optional) Set the current branch head (HEAD) to the commit.
* **depth**: (optional) Clone with a depth of 50 by default. You can remove --depth with the value 'false'.
* **directory**: (optional) The name of a directory to clone into.
* **password**: (optional) Set the password to be able to git clone from https with authentication.
* **privateKey**: (optional) Set the private key to be able to git clone from ssh.
You can create an application key named 'app-key' and use it in this action.
The public key have to be granted on your repository.
* **submodules**: (optional) Submodules are cloned by default, you can set 'false' to avoid this.
* **tag**: (optional) Useful when you want to git clone a specific tag. Empty by default, you can set to `{{.git.tag}}` to clone a tag from your repository. In this way, in your workflow payload you can add a key in your JSON like "git.tag": "1.0.2".
* **url**: URL must contain information about the transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository.
If your application is linked to a repository, you can use {{.git.url}} (clone over ssh) or {{.git.http_url}} (clone over https).
* **user**: (optional) Set the user to be able to git clone from https with authentication.


## Requirements

* **git**: type: binary Value: git


## YAML example

Example of a pipeline using GitClone action:
```yml
version: v1.0
name: Pipeline1
stages:
- Stage1
jobs:
- job: Job1
  stage: Stage1
  steps:
  - gitClone:
      branch: '{{.git.branch}}'
      commit: '{{.git.commit}}'
      directory: '{{.cds.workspace}}'
      privateKey: proj-mykey
      url: '{{.git.url}}'

```

## Example

## Notes

By default, depth is 50 and git clone with `--single-branch` automatically.
So, if you want to do in a step script `git diff anotherBranch`, you have to set depth to 'false'.

If there is no user && password && sshkey setted in action GitClone, CDS checks on Application VCS Strategy if some auth parameters can be used.
