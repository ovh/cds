      <description>What is CDS? CDS is a Continuous Delivery solution with an architecture featuring:
 A complete isolation between tenants High availability oriented architecture Automatic scaling Automation oriented with iso-feature API, CLI and WebUI  Designed for scalability, CDS tasks can run either on cloud infrastructure or on your own machines, should you start some workers using a hatchery.
CDS exposes an API available to workers and humans through cli or WebUI.</description>

      <description>A pipeline describes how things need to be executed in order to achieve wanted result. In CDS, a pipeline a defined on a project and can be used on several applications inside the same project.
A pipeline is structured in sequential stages containing one or multiple concurrent jobs.
In CDS there is several types of pipeline : build, testing and deployment. In Pipeline configuration file, default type is build.</description>

      <guid>https://ovh.github.com/cds/getting-started/concepts/stage/</guid>
      <description>Usually in CDS a build pipeline is structured of the following stages :
 Compile stage : Build the binaries Analysis &amp;amp; Unit Tests stage : Run all unit tests and analyse code quality Packaging stage : Build the final package, Virtual Machine Image or Docker Image.  In CDS, stages are executed sequentially if the previous stage is successfull.
You can define trigger conditions on a stage, to enable it on certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Job</title>

      <guid>https://ovh.github.com/cds/getting-started/concepts/job/</guid>
      <description>The Job is more important concept in CDS. It will be composed of steps which will be run sequencially. A Job will be executed is a dedicated workspace and each new run of a job will have a new dedicated workspace. It means that you cannot share a workspace between jobs or between two runs of a job.
A Job will be executed by a worker. CDS will choose and provision a worker for dependending of the requirements you define on your job.</description>

      <guid>https://ovh.github.com/cds/getting-started/concepts/step/</guid>
      <description>The steps of a job is the list of the different operation performed by the CDS worker. Each steps is based on an Action which is defined by CDS. The list of all actions is defined on *&amp;lt;your cds url ui&amp;gt;/#/action*. On the very first step failed, the job is marked as Failed and execution is stopped.
You can define a Step as final. It mean that even if the job is failed, the step will be executed.</description>

      <description>A pipeline is structured in sequential stages containing one or multiple concurrent jobs. A Job will be executed by a worker.
Building your own worker model enable you to integrate your own tools, or to customize the tools you need to use. For instance, to build an AngularJs application, you shall need a worker capable of installing npm tools, importing bower packages (these are nodeJs tools), building webfonts with fontforge, &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Run with Docker-Compose The docker-compose.yml contains:
 cds-db service with a postgresql cds-cache service with a redis cds-migrate service to prepare DB tables. cds-api service cds-ui service cds-hatchery-swarm service cds-hatchery-local service  Docker compose is very convenient to launch CDS for testing it. But this is not recommended for a Production Installation.
How to run $ git clone https://github.com/ovh/cds.git $ cd cds $ export HOSTNAME=$(hostname) # Create PG Database $ docker-compose up --no-recreate -d cds-db # check if db is UP # check if last log is &amp;quot;LOG: database system is ready to accept connections&amp;quot; $ docker-compose logs $ docker-compose up --no-recreate cds-migrate # You should have this log: &amp;quot;cds_cds-migrate_1 exited with code 0&amp;quot; # run API and UI $ docker-compose up cds-api cds-ui  Open a browser on http://localhost:2015, then register a new user.</description>

      <description>Hatchery is a binary dedicated to spawn and kill worker in accordance with build queue needs.
An hatchery is started with permissions to build all pipelines accessible from a given group, using token generated by user.
There are 5 modes for hatcheries:
 Local (Start workers on a single host) Local Docker (Start worker model instances on a single host) Marathon (Start worker model instances on a mesos cluster with marathon framework) Swarm (Start worker on a docker swarm cluster) Openstack (Start hosts on an openstack cluster)  Local mode Hatchery starts workers directly as local process.</description>

Create Openstack user In OVH manager, in cloud section, click on the menu on the Servers&amp;gt;Openstack item.
You will be able to create an Openstack user, enter description (name and password will be generated).
Add Openstack worker model We need to define an Openstack worker model to have Openstack hatchery booting workers.
We will create a model called docker:
 With low hardware capacity (vps-ssd-1) On Debian 8 With docker ready to use Git installed  First, define a udata file.</description>
