## Notes

By default, depth is 50 and git clone with `--single-branch` automatically.
So, if you want to do in a step script `git diff anotherBranch`, you have to set depth to 'false'.

If there is no user && password && sshkey setted in action GitClone, CDS checks on Application VCS Strategy if some auth parameters can be used.
