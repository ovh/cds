	"content": "What is CDS? CDS is a Continuous Delivery solution with an architecture featuring: A complete isolation between tenants High availability oriented architecture Automatic scaling Automation oriented with iso-feature API, CLI and WebUI Designed for scalability, CDS tasks can run either on cloud infrastructure or on your own machines, should you start some workers using a hatchery. CDS exposes an API available to workers and humans through cli or WebUI. What does CDS do? Basically, CDS allows users to create building and delivery pipelines for all your applications. An application is composed of one or multiple pipelines, that can be triggered: manually by VCS change by another pipeline by a hook General Creation of build and deployment pipelines Simple organisation by projects and applications Artifact storage available trough UI, API and CLI Reusable build and deployment Actions Packaging Declaration of worker models (specific hosts, docker image, openstack recipe) Conditional build path depending of build parameters (ie: git branch) Deployment Completely cross platform workers (built in Go) without any dependency Support for deployment environments (different sets of variable for the same deployment pipeline) Basic principles A action will start on any worker matching all its requirements Every action runs in a different worker, all build data needed for the next step should be uploaded as artifact It is possible to run some of your pipelines on-premise, some on CDS workers "

In CDS, a pipeline a defined on a project and can be used on several applications inside the same project. A pipeline is structured in sequential stages containing one or multiple concurrent jobs. In CDS there is several types of pipeline : build, testing and deployment. In Pipeline configuration file, default type is build. The goal is to make your pipeline the more reusable as possible. It have to be able to build, test or deploy all the tiers, services or micro-services of your project. You can also define ACL on a pipeline. Triggers Example "

In CDS, stages are executed sequentially if the previous stage is successfull. You can define trigger conditions on a stage, to enable it on certain conditions. For instance, you want to run the Compile Stage and Analysis &amp;amp; Unit Tests stage on all branches but the Packaging Stage on branches master and develop only.

A Job will be executed by a worker. CDS will choose and provision a worker for dependending of the requirements you define on your job. You can set as many requirements as you want, following those rules : Only one model can be set as requirement Only one hostname can be set as requirement Memory and Services requirements are availabe only on Docker models If you want to share files or artifact between jobs, stages or pipelines you have to use Artifact upload and Artifact download.

Workers will be spawn inside this container. $ docker-compose up cds-hatchery-local Running a hatchery &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; in a container is not recommanded. Use this way only for test purpose. After running this Hatchery, a worker will be spawned. Your pipeline will be in &amp;ldquo;Building&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;Success&amp;rdquo; status. Hatchery Docker Swarm The docker-compose.yml runs hatchery belonging to the shared.infra groups. A local hatchery spawn worker on same host than hatchery. This is usually useful for specific cases, as running job on specific hardware. But this hatchery does not make it possible to respect the isolation of workpaces of workers as they share the same workspace. There is another hatchery configured in docker-compose.yml file: a &amp;lsquo;swarm hatchery&amp;rsquo; Please check that your docker installation allows docker API calls on tcp://${HOSTNAME}:2375 Otherwise, please update environment variable DOCKER_HOST: tcp://${HOSTNAME}:2375 in docker-compose.yml $ docker-compose up cds-hatchery-swarm A swarm hatchery spwan CDS Worker inside dedicated container.
