# Worker


Workers connect to API using a `worker key`, previously generated by a user, thus sharing all its permissions.

It will then fetch all permitted actions in the queue and check action requirements against its own capabilities, before starting the build.

## Generate Worker token

Workers need to provide a token to API in order to register with correct permissions. You can generate a token for a given group using the CLI:

```shell
$ cds generate token --group shared.infra --expiration persistent
2706bda13748877c57029598b915d46236988c7c57ea0d3808524a1e1a3adef4
```
This token will allow a worker to build all applications group foo has access to.

Note: You must be admin of the group in order to generate a token for this group

Provide this key to the worker:

```shell
worker --api=<cds-api> --key=2706bda13748877c57029598b915d46236988c7c57ea0d3808524a1e1a3adef4
```
